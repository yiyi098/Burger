# Burger

### Overview

This is a burger-themed CRUD app that is deployed on Heroku. Some burgers are already added to the database and are shown in the 'Ready to be devoured!' list. As soon as the 'Devour Me!' button is clicked, the burger will be moved to the 'DEVOURED!' list, but still remain in the database. New burgers can be entered into the form in the middle and be added to the database and show up in the 'Ready to be devoured!' list. All burgers in the database will also contain a timestamp of when they are created.
